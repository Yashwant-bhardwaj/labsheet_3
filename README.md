What is Recursive Binary Search?
Recursive Binary Search is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target element in a sorted array using a divide and conquer approach. Instead of using loops, it calls itself recursively, reducing the search space by half in each step.

How it Works
Base Case: If the left index exceeds the right index, the element is not found.
Find Middle Element: Compare the middle element with the target.
Recursive Calls:
If the target is smaller than the middle element, search the left half.
If the target is larger, search the right half.
If found, return the index.
Why is Recursive Binary Search Used?
It provides a clean and simple implementation using recursion.
It is useful when dealing with sorted data where searching efficiency is required.
It is ideal for situations where recursion is preferred over iteration (e.g., tree traversal).
Advantages of Recursive Binary Search
Efficient: Runs in O(log n) time complexity, making it much faster than linear search (O(n)).
Simpler Code: More readable and easier to implement in recursive environments.
Good for Large Sorted Data: Performs well with large datasets where searching needs to be fast.

Disadvantages
Higher Memory Usage: Uses extra space in the call stack due to recursion.
Limited by Recursion Depth: Deep recursion may cause stack overflow for very large arrays.
Requires Sorted Data: Doesn't work correctly on unsorted arrays.
